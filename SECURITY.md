# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Digital Caribbean Consortium takes the security of our software and services seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by:
1. Opening a security advisory in the specific repository (if available)
2. Creating a private issue with the label "security" (if the repository supports it)
3. Contacting the repository maintainers directly

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days
- We will send a more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow the principle of responsible disclosure
- Security vulnerabilities will be addressed as quickly as possible
- Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter
- Credit will be given to security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the latest stable versions of our projects. Please refer to individual repository documentation for specific version support policies.

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to our repositories, please:
- Never commit sensitive information (credentials, API keys, etc.)
- Use secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks

## Questions?

If you have questions about this security policy, please open an issue in the relevant repository or contact the maintainers.
